# AIR WRITING RECOGNITION USING MACHINE LEARNING

Air-writing recognition has received wide attention due to its potential application in intelligent systems. To date, some of the fundamental problems in isolated writing have not been addressed effectively. This paper presents a simple yet effective air-writing recognition approach based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A robust and efficient hand tracking algorithm is proposed to extract air-writing trajectories collected by a single web camera.
